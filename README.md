In this repository, we use the ggplot2 data visualization library available in R, to visualize the data about colleges in California state. <br/>
We use the dot size to represent undergraduate college population in different cities, and color code them based on if they're private or public institutions. <br/>
The final resulting visualization can be viewed in the png file of this repo.
